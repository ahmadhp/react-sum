[Github Issue](https://github.com/ahmadhp/react-sum/issues/1)

## Project Requirements

#### React component

The Component must have a user input, parse it, run the function on it
and report the results.

- In case of an error, or an empty input, it should show a respective
  error message to the user.
- You may write tests, to make sure the component renders the correct
  information according to each case.
- You may install and use any third party libraries you may need
  either for the component, the form or the tests.

#### Function definition

detectSums():

- Input: an array of numbers, e.g. A = [1, 2, 3]
- Output: an array of matches, as objects, containing keys pA, pB, sum
  such that A[p1] + A[p2] === A[sum], e.g. [{ pA: 0, pB: 1, sum: 2 }]]
